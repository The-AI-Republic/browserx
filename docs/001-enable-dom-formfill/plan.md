# Implementation Plan: DOM Tool Form Fill Action

**Branch**: `001-enable-dom-formfill` | **Date**: 2025-10-31 | **Spec**: [specs/001-enable-dom-formfill/spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-enable-dom-formfill/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Extend the DOM Tool with a `fill_form` action that accepts a structured payload, applies values to all resolvable fields in one operation, and returns granular success/failure feedback while deprecating the standalone `FormAutomationTool`.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9  
**Primary Dependencies**: Svelte, Vite, internal DOM Tool framework (BaseTool, TabGroupManager)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory DOM interactions only)  
**Testing**: Vitest with jsdom + Svelte Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Chromium-based browser extension surfaces (content scripts, service worker, side panel)  
**Project Type**: Browser automation extension (web)  
**Performance Goals**: Achieve 40% faster multi-field form completion versus sequential actions (spec SC-002)  
**Constraints**: Preserve one-peek-one-action contract; avoid regressions to existing single-field interactions  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-agent orchestration supporting typical web forms (up to ~10 fields per action)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The constitution file contains placeholder sections with no enforceable principles, constraints, or workflow gates. No violations identified; proceed with standard prudence and re-confirm after design output.

**Post-design review**: Phase 1 deliverables (research, data model, contracts, quickstart) remain aligned with the placeholder constitution; no new gates introduced.

**Structure Decision**: Feature work centers on `src/tools/DomTool` and supporting utilities under `src/content` with validation via `tests/integration/content`; no new top-level directories required.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
