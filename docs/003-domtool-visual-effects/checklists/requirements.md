## Notes

### Validation Results

**All items passed** - Specification is ready for planning phase.

#### Content Quality Review:
- Spec focuses on user needs (visual feedback, control, non-blocking operation)
- Written in business-friendly language describing behaviors and outcomes
- Technology requirements (Svelte, Shadow DOM) mentioned only in Input context and Assumptions, not in requirements
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

#### Requirement Completeness Review:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- Each FR is testable (e.g., FR-008 specifies 300-1500ms animation duration, FR-002 lists exact input events to block)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (SC-001: 300ms, SC-004: 1 second, SC-006: 60fps)
- Success criteria are user-focused (no mention of specific technologies or implementation)
- 15 acceptance scenarios across 3 user stories cover all primary flows
- 6 edge cases identified covering failure modes, concurrency, environment changes, element stability, and iframe handling
- Scope clearly bounded to visual effects layer, explicitly non-blocking from DomTool functionality
- 14 assumptions documented covering technical prerequisites, DomTool responsibilities, iframe coordinate calculation, and constraints

#### Feature Readiness Review:
- Each of 22 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios prioritized (P1: core visualization, P2: control, P3: analysis feedback)
- 10 measurable success criteria define completion thresholds
- Spec maintains abstraction - describes what visual effects do, not how they're implemented

### Updates

**2025-10-25 (14:30)**: Updated control button position from "top-right corner" to "bottom center of screen" per user feedback. Changes made to User Story 2 (acceptance scenario 4) and FR-003. Validation still passes.

**2025-10-25 (14:45)**: Clarified element stability responsibility in edge cases. DomTool is responsible for ensuring elements are stable and visible before emitting action signals (simulating human behavior - humans don't click moving/scrolling elements). Visual effects simply animate to stable coordinates provided by DomTool. Updated edge case for moving/scrolling elements and added two new assumptions (now 12 total assumptions). Validation still passes.

**2025-10-25 (15:00)**: Clarified iframe handling architecture. Visual effects DO NOT inject into iframes - they always stay at browser page level (top-level document). Visual effect component calculates screen viewport coordinates for iframe elements to display effects at correct positions. This ensures consistent feedback regardless of iframe nesting or cross-origin restrictions. Added FR-021, updated iframe edge case, and added 2 new assumptions about iframe coordinate calculation (now 14 total assumptions, 21 functional requirements). Validation still passes.

**2025-10-25 (15:15)**: Clarified independence of overlay and visual effects. "Take Over" button now explicitly removes the semi-transparent overlay (not just modifies it) while visual effects (cursor animations and ripple effects) continue to display for agent actions. Added FR-006 to explicitly state overlay and visual effects operate independently. Updated FR-004, User Story 2 acceptance scenarios 1-2, Independent Test description, and takeover edge case. Renumbered FR-006 through FR-021 to FR-007 through FR-022 (now 22 functional requirements). Validation still passes.

**2025-10-25 (15:30)**: Changed pointing hand cursor from external SVG file to embedded/hard-coded SVG content. Updated FR-007 to specify "embedded SVG" instead of "from pointinghand.svg". Updated assumption from "pointinghand.svg asset is available at specified path" to "Pointing hand cursor SVG content is embedded in the visual effect component code (hard-coded, not loaded from external file)". Updated Input description requirement 3 to reflect embedded SVG. This eliminates runtime file loading dependency. Validation still passes.
