# Specification Quality Checklist: CDP Screenshot Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Overall Assessment**: PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and pass quality standards:

1. **Content Quality**:
   - The specification is written from a user/agent perspective (e.g., "agent needs to visually inspect", "system needs to manage screenshot files")
   - No programming language details, framework mentions, or code structure in requirements
   - All sections focus on capabilities and outcomes rather than implementation approaches

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No clarification markers present - all requirements are fully specified
   - Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-002 can be tested by capturing a screenshot and verifying PNG file exists)
   - Success criteria include specific metrics (>95% viewport detection accuracy, 3-second capture time, >90% click accuracy)
   - Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format and are independently verifiable
   - Edge cases cover failure scenarios, permission issues, responsive layouts, and content changes
   - Scope is bounded by explicit Non-Goals section

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each of 15 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - 5 user stories cover all major flows with priority ranking
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of TypeScript, specific libraries, or implementation patterns)
   - Specification describes what the system does from user perspective, not how it's built

**Ready for next phase**: This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` without requiring clarification.
