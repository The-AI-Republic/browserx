# Specification Quality Checklist: LLM Runtime Data Cache

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Detailed Review Notes:

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ While IndexedDB is mentioned as a technology choice, it's appropriately placed in the user requirements context and treated as a constraint rather than implementation detail
- ✅ Specification focuses on LLM behavior and user-facing outcomes (caching, context management, multi-step workflows)
- ✅ Language is accessible - explains the problem (context overflow) and solution (metadata-based caching) without technical jargon
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific and actionable
- ✅ Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-002 can be verified by inspecting generated keys, FR-009 can be tested by attempting to store 6MB)
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (100ms, 50MB, 95%, 500 bytes, etc.)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details - they focus on user-observable outcomes (task completion, operation speed, reliability rates)
- ✅ Each user story includes 2-3 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases cover quota, corruption, size limits, concurrency, availability - comprehensive boundary condition coverage
- ✅ Scope clearly defined with "Out of Scope" section explicitly excluding cross-session sharing, encryption, compression, analytics, etc.
- ✅ Dependencies listed (IndexedDB API, Session class, BaseTool, system prompt mechanism, UUID generation)
- ✅ Assumptions documented (quota limits, persistence model, serialization, etc.)

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ FR-001 to FR-016 all have implicit acceptance criteria via the user stories and edge cases
- ✅ Four prioritized user stories (P1: cache write, P1: cache read, P2: session management, P3: updates) cover the complete workflow
- ✅ Success criteria SC-001 to SC-007 directly map to the feature goals: enable complex tasks, maintain performance, ensure reliability
- ✅ No implementation leakage - while IndexedDB is mentioned, it's properly treated as a user requirement/constraint, not a design decision

### Conclusion

The specification is well-structured, complete, and ready for the next phase. It successfully captures:
- The user problem (context overflow in multi-step tasks)
- The solution approach (metadata-based caching with selective retrieval)
- Clear success metrics (task completion, performance, reliability)
- Appropriate scope boundaries (session-scoped, JSON-only, no advanced features)

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.
